1. Project Title & Headline
   
Sales Performance Analytics Dashboard

A dynamic Power BI dashboard for tracking e-commerce KPIs, analyzing sales trends, and deriving actionable business insights.

3. Short Description / Purpose
This interactive Sales Dashboard was developed to transform raw sales data into a clear, visual story of business performance. It exists to empower stakeholders with at-a-glance insights into revenue, profitability, and product category performance, enabling data-driven decision-making.

4. Tech Stack
Data Visualization: Microsoft Power BI
Data Processing & Analysis: Power Query, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Data Presentation: Interactive Visuals, KPI Cards

5. Data Source
The dashboard is built using a simulated e-commerce/supply chain dataset, typical of what a retail business would generate. This includes transactional data for orders, products, and customers.

6. Features & Highlights
Business Problem & Goal: Businesses often struggle with siloed and unorganized sales data, making it difficult to answer critical questions about performance. The goal of this dashboard was to create a single source of truth to monitor key metrics, identify profitable segments, and understand sales trends over time.

--Walkthrough of Key Visualizations:

a. Executive Summary KPIs: 
At the top, key performance indicators (KPIs) for Total Revenue ($438K), Total Profit ($37K), Total Quantity Sold (6K), and Average Order Value ($121) provide an immediate performance snapshot.

b. Payment Method Analysis: 
A pie chart breaks down order volume by payment type, revealing that Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most popular method (44%), crucial for optimizing payment processing workflows.

c. Profitability by Product: 
A bar chart analyzes profit contribution across sub-categories (e.g., Printers, Bookcases, Chairs), instantly highlighting the best and worst-performing product lines.

d. Sales Trend Analysis: 
A line chart tracks the count of profitable transactions over several years, allowing users to identify seasonal patterns, growth trends, and potential periods of concern.

--Business Impact & Insights:

a. Improved Financial Visibility: 
Stakeholders can instantly assess overall financial health and track progress against targets.

b. Strategic Decision-Making: 
Identifying that "Chairs" dominate quantity sold (83% in one chart) while other categories drive profit informs inventory and marketing strategy.

c. Trend Identification: 
The monthly profit trend allows management to investigate the causes behind peaks and troughs, leading to better demand planning and resource allocation.

d. Customer Behavior Insight: 
Understanding the prevalence of COD payments can guide investment in payment gateway integrations and fraud prevention.
